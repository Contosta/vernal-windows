<p>This repository includes algorithms used to identify thresholds that occur during the vernal window,  which is a period that describes the end of of winter and the start of the growing season. The vernal window starts when air temperatures rise above zero degrees celcius and ends when forests leaf out and pastures, croplands, and lawns green up.  A series of dramatic transitions occurs within this window as the system crosses rapid thermodynamic and biogeochemical thresholds that drive energy, water, solute, and carbon flows.  Contosta et al. (2016) describe the sequence of thresholds that occur within the vernal window, lags between thresholds, and shifts in the timing of these lags with climate change.  This paper is currently in review.  The research was supported by the New Hampshire EPSCoR Ecosystem and Society Project (NSF-EPS 1101245).</p>
